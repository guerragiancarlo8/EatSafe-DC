EatsafeDC
=========

Web application that returns a list of restaurants that are safe for people with common food allergies. Capstone Project for Spring 2013. Back-end server built with Python Flask


In this repository is a file called Documentation.docx. Please open it and follow the step-by-step instructions on how to get the application up
and running. Should be pretty straightforward. If you have any questions, please contact me! :)

Some notes:

1. The documentation was made with the assumption that the user is either utilizing linux ubuntu(any version). Currently working on some windows
and MacOS documentation. 

2. Please disregard step 1. Instead, just clone this repository into your desktop(for ease) and call it eatsafedc(also for ease).
